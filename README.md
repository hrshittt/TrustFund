Credit Loan Web Application

Overview

This is a full-stack credit loan web application designed to connect borrowers and lenders in a single platform. Unlike traditional banking systems or existing apps, this platform simplifies small loans by providing a transparent, trustworthy, and fast loan process. Users can act as borrowers, lenders, or both, with tools to make informed decisions based on credit scores, risk indicators, and repayment histories.

The platform is ideal for small-scale lending and borrowing, allowing users to filter options by interest rates, credit score, location, and other factors. Additionally, it supports messaging and local connectivity, enabling nearby users to meet in person if needed.
